# 15 Puzzle Solver

An AI-based solver for the classic **15-Puzzle Game** using both **uninformed** (BFS, DFS) and **informed** (A* with Manhattan Distance & Misplaced Tiles heuristic) search algorithms. Implemented in Python with object-oriented design and clear modular structure.

---

## Project Overview

This project is a part of the *Artificial Intelligence* course at **National Textile University, Faisalabad**, demonstrating various search techniques applied to a classic combinatorial problem: the 15-puzzle.

The puzzle consists of a 4x4 grid of numbered tiles (1â€“15) and one empty space. The objective is to slide the tiles into the correct order using valid moves.

## Algorithms Implemented

### Uninformed Search

- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**  
  Explores all nodes at the current depth before moving deeper. Ensures the shortest solution path. Uses a FIFO Queue.

- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**  
  Explores as deep as possible down one path before backtracking. May not find optimal solutions. Uses a LIFO Stack.

### Informed Search

- **A\* Search Algorithm**  
  Combines path cost and heuristic estimation to find optimal paths.

  #### Heuristics Used:
  - *Manhattan Distance*: Sum of tile distances from their goal positions.
  - *Misplaced Tiles*: Counts tiles not in their correct position.
